### Pset 3: Algorithms - Using voting in an election as a way to study algorithms in C, including sorting algorithms and algorithmic runtime.
* **plurality.c** - Implements an election that produces a winner by plurality vote.

* **runoff.c** - Implements a ranked choice election that produces a winner by instant runoff.

* **tideman.c** - Implements an election by the Tideman algorithm that produces a condorcet winner - a candidate who best wins against every other candidate.

### Pset 4: Memory
* Filter - In this assignment, I applied filters to bitmap images (Ã  la Instagram) to explore how C handles memory. I applied grayscale, sepia, and blur filters. I also reflected the image and applied an edge detection algorithm to it.

These are the first programs I wrote with Python. 
# dna
A program to identify individuals using DNA samples.

Some portions of the human genome contain higher diversity than others.

These sections contain Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) which are a pattern
of nucleotides, (A, T, C, and G), which repeat consecutively for some length.

The length of the repeats for a given STR is characteristic of a person's DNA.
It's possible that two people could have the same length for a single STR (P = .05 - .2). However, by
looking at multiple STRs, we can obtain a signature with which we can match a
DNA sample with an individual with a very high degree of confidence.

This program looks at 8 STRs and uses Python utilities to compare them with DNA sequences in a CSV database file.

# sentimental-hello
A basic 'hello, world'-type program that gets a name and returns a greeting.
# sentimental-mario
A Python version of a program I [previously wrote with C](https://github.com/akcode2/cs50/tree/master/1%20-%20C#marioc). Prints two half pyramids to the terminal.
# sentimental-credit
A Python version of a program [I previously wrote with C](https://github.com/akcode2/cs50/tree/master/1%20-%20C#creditc). Using methods like str.startswith() and string slicing techniques, I was able to do this with fewer lines of code.
# sentimental-readability
A Python version of a program [I previously wrote with C](https://github.com/akcode2/cs50/blob/master/2%20-%20Arrays/README.md#readability). Computes the reading grade level of some text and does it more succinctly.

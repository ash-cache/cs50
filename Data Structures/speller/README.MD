I wanted to find a good hash function to use in this problem. Since I didn't know how to choose a "good" hash function, I referred to the paper, Performance of the most common non‐cryptographic hash functions (Estébanez, C., Saez, Y., Recio, G. and Isasi, P. (2014)) as a place to start. I learned about the [Avalanche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect) and how it's important for creating a good distribution of hash values. lookup3 seemed to be a good candidate while BuzHash could be a unique hash function to test later. CityHash and SpookyHash are good options for x86-64 architecture (which seems to be a safe bet for what AWS is using) according to https://blog.reverberate.org/2012/01/state-of-hash-functions-2012.html.
